 - It is assumed that the data files have name of the format "conference-acronym""Year"-"pc e.g. (ase2007-pc.txt)
    
 - The data contains "Author Name" on each line of file or "Author Postion Held Acronym": "Author Name"

## Please email Sudeep, Mohit, Rajdeep or Ira before testing as we need to upgrade the RDS DB instance type.Right now it is set to t2.micro which gives poor performance for the queries
